## Facial Verification with Siamese Network

This repository contains the code for a project implementing facial verification using a Siamese Network. The project also includes a real-time application built with Kivy and OpenCV.

**Project Overview:**

* Converts a research paper on Siamese Networks into functional Python code.
* Collects, preprocesses, and augments facial data for robust training.
* Builds a Siamese Network architecture with embedding and distance layers.
* Implements a comprehensive training loop with loss function, optimizer, and checkpointing.
* Creates a real-time facial verification application using Kivy and OpenCV.

**Getting Started:**

This project requires Python libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV. Please refer to the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list of dependencies.

**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Folder containing the preprocessed facial data.
* `notebooks/`: (Optional) Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis or visualization (if applicable).
* `src/`: Contains the core Python code for the project.
    * `model.py`: Defines the Siamese Network architecture.
    * `train.py`: Implements the training loop and functionalities.
    * `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, augmentation, etc.
    * `realtime_app.py` (Optional): Code for the Kivy-based real-time application (if applicable).
* `README.md`: This file (you're reading it now!)

**Further Exploration:**

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters. The project provides a solid foundation for understanding and implementing Siamese Networks for facial verification tasks.
